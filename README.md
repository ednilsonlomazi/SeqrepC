# SeqrepC
SeqrepC is a module in C language used in Seqreppy fundamental operations. 

# Satus
The C m√≥dule is still beeing developed.
But, in a near future, all Seqreppy fundamental operations (convert genomic sequences to numerical sequences, store and get data from disk) will be done by C language, using C/Python API.

Even that SeqrepC is destined to Seqreppy, the module is still functional without Seqreppy, beeing possible to import the module in a python file even that is writed in C (thanks to C/Python API)
